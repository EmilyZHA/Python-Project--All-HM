    "A vector can be described as a collection of numbers, e.g. (3,5,1). In two-dimensional vectors (vectors which only have two elements), the first one is often referred to as __x__ and the second as __y__.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add two vectors __u__ and __v__, you again get a vector whose elements are the sum of the elements of __u__ and __v__ at the same index. For example: (1,4)+(3,2)=(1+3,4+2)=(4,6). This is also called \"element-wise addition\".\n",

    "Remember: Magic methods or dunder methods are methods that when implemented can be used in some implicit contexts. For example, if a class implements __\\_\\_add\\_\\___, two instances of this class can be added using the inline operator `+`. You can identify magic methods by the double underscores surrounding them.\n",

    "- First, you need to implement the constructor. It is given the x and y values of the vector, which we need to store in attributes.\n",
    "- Next, implement the magic method __\\_\\_add\\_\\___. Besides `self`, it is given the other vector that is supposed to be added to the first one. It should return their sum, which itself is a Vector2D.\n",
    "- Lastly, we want to be able to print a Vector2D, just like we can print tuples or lists. For this, the __\\_\\_str\\_\\___ method is responsible - it gets called whenever Python tries to convert an object to a string. It should return a string representing the object in some way."
